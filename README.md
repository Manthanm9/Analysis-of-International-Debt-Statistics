# Analyzing International Debt Data 🌍💰

In this project, we aim to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank 🏛️. The dataset provides information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across various debt indicators. Through our analysis, we will answer several key questions related to international debt:

**Total Amount of Debt 💸:** We will calculate the total amount of debt owed by all the countries listed in the dataset. This will give us an understanding of the overall state of the global economy concerning debt.

**Country with Maximum Debt 🏆:** We will identify the country that owns the maximum amount of debt and determine the corresponding debt amount. This will provide insights into the economic condition of that particular country.

**Average Debt Across Indicators 📊:** We will find the average amount of debt owed by countries for each debt indicator. This will help us understand the distribution of debt across different categories and indicators.

**Distinct Countries 🌐:** We will extract the number of unique countries present in the dataset. This will give us an idea of the global reach of the debt data.

Throughout the project, we will gain valuable insights into the international debt landscape and its impact on different countries and their economies. Let's dive into the data and discover fascinating patterns and trends! 🚀📈
