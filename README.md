# Analysis of International Debt Statistics
In this project, I used SQL queries to answer important questions regarding international debt by analysing the World Bank debtÂ dataset. The dataset provides figures on the amount of debt (in USD) owing by developing nations in several categories from 1970 to 2015. This analysis can be used to address problems such as:

1.What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
2.Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
3.What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

## About Data Source:
The International Debt Statistics (IDS) is a database developed and maintained by the World Bank that provides a comprehensive overview of external debt and financial flows of developing countries. The database covers more than 200 countries and territories.
